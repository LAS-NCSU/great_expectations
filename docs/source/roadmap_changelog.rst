Changelog and Roadmap
=====================

Planned Features
----------------
* More expectation coverage in SqlAlchemyDataset
* Support for meta variables
* Support for multi-column expectations
* Improved variable typing
* New Datasets (e.g. Spark)
* Support for non-tabular datasources (e.g. JSON, XML, AVRO)
* Real-time/streaming and adaption of distributional expectations

develop
-------
* Add new expectation expect_column_values_to_not_match_regex_list.
  * Change behavior of expect_column_values_to_match_regex_list to use python re.findall in PandasDataset, relaxing \
  matching of individuals expressions to allow matches anywhere in the string.

v.0.4.1
-------
* Correct inclusion of new data_context module in source distribution

v.0.4.0
-------
* Initial implementation of data context API and SqlAlchemyDataset including implementations of the following expectations:
  * expect_column_to_exist
  * expect_table_row_count_to_be
  * expect_table_row_count_to_be_between
  * expect_column_values_to_not_be_null
  * expect_column_values_to_be_null
  * expect_column_values_to_be_in_set
  * expect_column_values_to_be_between
  * expect_column_mean_to_be
  * expect_column_min_to_be
  * expect_column_max_to_be
  * expect_column_sum_to_be
  * expect_column_unique_value_count_to_be_between
  * expect_column_proportion_of_unique_values_to_be_between
* Major refactor of output_format to new result_format parameter. See docs for full details.
  * exception_list and related uses of the term exception have been renamed to unexpected
  * the output formats are explicitly hierarchical now, with BOOLEAN_ONLY < BASIC < SUMMARY < COMPLETE. `column_aggregate_expectation`s now return element count and related information included at the BASIC level or higher.
* New expectation available for parameterized distributions--expect_column_parameterized_distribution_ks_test_p_value_to_be_greater_than (what a name! :) -- (thanks @ccnobbli)
* ge.from_pandas() utility (thanks @schrockn)
* Pandas operations on a PandasDataset now return another PandasDataset (thanks @dlwhite5)
* expect_column_to_exist now takes a column_index parameter to specify column order (thanks @louispotok)
* Top-level validate option (ge.validate())
* ge.read_json() helper (thanks @rjurney)
* Behind-the-scenes improvements to testing framework to ensure parity across data contexts.
* Documentation improvements, bug-fixes, and internal api improvements

v.0.3.2
-------
* Include requirements file in source dist to support conda

v.0.3.1
--------
* Fix infinite recursion error when building custom expectations
* Catch dateutil parsing overflow errors

v.0.2
-----
* Distributional expectations and associated helpers are improved and renamed to be more clear regarding the tests they apply
* Expectation decorators have been refactored significantly to streamline implementing expectations and support custom expectations
* API and examples for custom expectations are available
* New output formats are available for all expectations
* Significant improvements to test suite and compatibility
